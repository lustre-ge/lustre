# Lustre
---
**Lustre** is a high-performance, modular, and creative 3D voxel-based game engine developed for our upcoming game project. Lustre emphasizes immersive worlds, extensive customization, and effortless extensibility, making it ideal for integrating complex gameplay mechanics, realistic physics, and stunning visual elements.

Our mission is to continuously refine and evolve Lustre alongside our primary game, incorporating practical feedback and enhancements gained through active development. We aim to expand our indie development team and foster a collaborative environment to drive Lustre’s future capabilities.
